<h1>The Story of AM2R</h1>
<p>AM2R began development around 2006 by Milton Guasti (DoctorM64).
<br>AM2R's full name, Another Metroid 2 Remake, came from the fact that back then there were a lot of remakes in the work.<br>The game was reimagined, innovated upon in ways that weren't possible on the original GameBoy hardware, given proper color and 16 bit graphics, and had its physics brought up to standard. The game was, in every way, a remake.
<br>Several of the old temples were turned into completely new facilities, such as the Hydro Station. A completely new one, the Distribution Center, was added.<br>In 2016, after nearly 10 years in development, on Metroid's 30th anniversary, it released.<br>A day later, it got a DMCA request and was taken down.<br><br>The game is currently under development from a new team, but the base game itself isn't officially available anywhere.</p>
